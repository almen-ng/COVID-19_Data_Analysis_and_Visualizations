# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Background Information
> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
>
> The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 
>
> The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow). [1]

## Purpose 
To explore the data from [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) by using Data Science techniques I have learned.

## Disclaimer
This mini-project will not make any predictions and is not intended to be used in professional environments. If you acquire a resource published by domain experts, I have included links below by reputable, respected institutions:

## Next Steps 
I intend to explore data specifically for Canada using datasets from [Arcgis](https://resources-covid19canada.hub.arcgis.com/search?groupIds=515d6baaecea4e96bb7c718f0cd7199d).
